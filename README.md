# Mars_Challenge
Web-scraping and data analysis 

### Overview of Project 
#
This is a collection of Mars’ weather data from the [Mars News Site]( https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) and the [Mars Temperature Data Site]( https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html). Chrome DevTools was used to explore the elements within these websites. Working with Splinter, we were able to automate web browsing process. The data was scraped utilizing BeautifulSoup and Splinter together. The data was then transformed, organized, and saved to a CSV file with Pandas and Python.
